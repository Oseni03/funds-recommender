Currently, fisheries impacts are often not explicitly accounted for in lock and dam operations.&nbsp;For example, nearly all dams in the Mississippi Basin and southeastern United States are, by and large, not designed to accommodate fish passage for native fish.&nbsp;Moreover, many of these dams are now being viewed as possible components for control and management of aquatic nuisance species. Some native fishes are now protected under provisions of the Endangered Species Act further heightening interest in the possible influence of locks and dams on fish movement. A primary challenge of the proposed work is to develop strategies that allow fish movement past locks and dams while not impacting navigation operations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The National Information Collaboration for Ecohydraulics (NICE) has been established with the mission of applying ecohydraulic principles to navigation infrastructure at multiple scales and facilitating accurate engineering forecasts of fisheries outcomes based on research and development for multiple contexts.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Program Description/Objective: (brief description of the anticipated work)</span></p>\n<p>The aim of this research is to address the challenge of obtaining multidimensional high-resolution fish positions near infrastructure.&nbsp;Locks and dams are often hydraulically energetic making the use of current acoustic tracking difficult or impossible. These data sets are viewed as critical missing elements in understanding fish movement near infrastructure. This limits the design possibilities for implementing effective passage, mitigation, or management at locks and dams.&nbsp;This project will develop new techniques that allow the collection of high-resolution fish tracks near infrastructure, the implementation and evaluation of real-time tracking, and improved post-processing. Multiple species, both native and non-native, require data. Field sites will be in the Mississippi River and its tributaries with a particular focus on application to future fish passage structures in the middle Mississippi River.</p>",

NSLI-Y increases the number of American youth (ages 15 to 18) who learn critical foreign languages in support of strengthening national security, building mutual understanding, and preparing for the global economy. NSLI-Y offers overseas summer and academic year programs, as well as 10-week virtual programs (Virtual NSLI-Y) for beginners. U.S. public and private non-profit organizations, meeting the provisions described in Internal Revenue Code section 26 USC 501(c)(3), may submit proposals to cooperate with ECA in the overall administration of NSLI-Y organizational responsibilities and the implementation of overseas summer and academic year language programs for approximately 535 participants, and virtual programs for approximately 200 participants, according to the guidance detailed in this NOFO. Overseas NSLI-Y program activities funded by this award will take place during summer 2025 and academic year 2025-2026 in locations where Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Persian (Tajiki or Farsi), Russian, and Turkish are widely used in everyday life. Virtual NSLI-Y programs will take place online during the 2025-26 academic year. In addition, the award supports programming for NSLI-Y and Virtual NSLI-Y alumni of all program years. The award recipient will manage the comprehensive organizational and administrative responsibilities of this program and will identify qualified sub-award recipients to implement many of the overseas language programs. Please see the full announcement for additional information.</p>",

NSLI-Y increases the number of American youth (ages 15 to 18) who learn critical foreign languages in support of strengthening national security, building mutual understanding, and preparing for the global economy.  NSLI-Y offers overseas summer and academic year programs, as well as 10-week virtual programs (Virtual NSLI-Y) for beginners. U.S. public and private non-profit organizations, meeting the provisions described in Internal Revenue Code section 26 USC 501(c)(3), may submit proposals to cooperate with ECA in the overall administration of NSLI-Y organizational responsibilities and the implementation of overseas summer and academic year language programs for approximately 535 participants, and virtual programs for approximately 200 participants, according to the guidance detailed in this NOFO.  Overseas NSLI-Y program activities funded by this award will take place during summer 2025 and academic year 2025-2026 in locations where Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Persian (Tajiki or Farsi), Russian, and Turkish are widely used in everyday life.  Virtual NSLI-Y programs will take place online during the 2025-26 academic year.  In addition, the award supports programming for NSLI-Y and Virtual NSLI-Y alumni of all program years.  The award recipient will manage the comprehensive organizational and administrative responsibilities of this program and will identify qualified sub-award recipients to implement many of the overseas language programs.

        "synopsisDesc": "<p>This Notice of Funding Opportunity announces the availability of funds and solicits applications from eligible entities to develop projects for hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) reclamation and innovative destruction technologies. Section 60109 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided the EPA with $15 million for competitive grants for \u201creclaim and innovative destruction technologies\u201d consistent with subsections (a) through (i) and subsection (k) of section 103 division S of Public Law 116-260 (42 U.S.C. 7675) (also known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act). Enacted in 2020, the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act authorizes the EPA to address climate-damaging greenhouse gases (GHGs) called HFCs by: phasing down their production and consumption, maximizing reclamation and minimizing releases from equipment, and facilitating the transition to next-generation technologies through sector-based restrictions on HFCs. HFCs are potent GHGs commonly used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, as well as foams and many other applications. A global phasedown of HFCs is expected to avoid up to 0.5\u00b0C of global warming by 2100. There are hundreds of possible HFC compounds. The 18 HFCs listed as regulated substances by the AIM Act are some of the most commonly used HFCs and have high impacts as measured by the quantity emitted multiplied by their respective global warming potentials (GWPs). For more information on the AIM Act and its implementing regulations, please visit https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction.</p>",

Agencies may apply as a joint application on behalf of several state agencies, however, only one agency can accept the Cooperative Agreement and serve as the award recipient. The SMA must be included as a subrecipient of the Cooperative Agreement if it is not the award recipient. Eligible applicants are all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories that have at least 10,000 resident Medicare FFS beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B residing in the state or sub-state region based on the most recent data available from CMS Medicare Monthly Enrollment data. U.S. territories include American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Applicants may select to participate at the state level or designate a sub-state region, subject to CMS approval during the application review. Award recipients may have the ability to expand the sub-state region during the Pre-Implementation Period subject to approval by CMS. Approval of such requests are not guaranteed. States in which Making Care Primary Model (MCP) is operating on a statewide basis may not participate in AHEAD. If MCP is operating in a sub-state region of a state, that state would be eligible to apply to participate in AHEAD in a different sub-state region with no geographic overlap.",

The Model will include specific components to help each award recipient to achieve these goals, including an initial investment via the Cooperative Agreement award to support planning and implementation activities, Medicare fee-for-service and Medicaid hospital global budgets for participating hospitals, and a primary care program for participating primary care practices.</p><p><br></p><p>The AHEAD Model will operate for 11 years (2024-2034). Applicants must select one of three Cohorts to participate in based on their stage of readiness to implement the Model. CMS will select, via a competitive process, up to eight award recipients. Up to $12 million in Cooperative Agreement award funding will be available to each selected award recipient over the course of up to six years.

Agencies may apply as a joint application on behalf of several state agencies, however, only one agency can accept the Cooperative Agreement and serve as the award recipient. The SMA must be included as a subrecipient of the Cooperative Agreement if it is not the award recipient. Eligible applicants are all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories that have at least 10,000 resident Medicare FFS beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B residing in the state or sub-state region based on the most recent data available from CMS Medicare Monthly Enrollment data. U.S. territories include American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Applicants may select to participate at the state level or designate a sub-state region, subject to CMS approval during the application review. Award recipients may have the ability to expand the sub-state region during the Pre-Implementation Period subject to approval by CMS. Approval of such requests are not guaranteed. States in which Making Care Primary Model (MCP) is operating on a statewide basis may not participate in AHEAD. If MCP is operating in a sub-state region of a state, that state would be eligible to apply to participate in AHEAD in a different sub-state region with no geographic overlap.",

It is a technical, financial, and educational assistance program that delivers nature-based solutions to more than 84 percent of Americans. The program works to restore, sustain, and manage more than 140 million acres of urban and community forest lands for the benefit of communities across the United States and its Territories. Healthy urban &amp; community forests and green infrastructure are not only critical to all our nation\u2019s forests, but research and studies have also shown that our urban and community forests are essential to the economic, environmental, physical, and mental well-being of our citizens.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://urbanforestplan.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FinalActionPlan_Complete_11_17_15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: black;\">National Ten Year Urban and Community Forestry Action Plan (2016-2026)</a>, (Action Plan) <span style=\"color: black;\">urban and community stewardship has made progress</span> over the last decade to address the health of urban and community forests. <span style=\"color: black;\">For example, sixty (60%) </span>percent of cities are utilizing new and emerging tools to assist propagation, planting, management, maintenance, and stewardship.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p> \n<p><u>CATEGORY: </u><u style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;</u><strong>Urban and Community Forestry Climate-Resilient Tree Nurseries </strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: black;\">This year\u2019s category addresses components of Goal 4 and Goal 5 in the Ten-Year Action Plan:</span></p> \n<p><strong style=\"color: black;\">Goal 4 Strategy A: Action 1: </strong><span style=\"color: black;\">Increase the biodiversity, health, and resilience of trees in urban and community forests.</span></p> \n<p><strong style=\"color: black;\">Goal 5 Strategy A: </strong><span style=\"color: black;\">Support the use of more locally grown, regionally adapted, insect and pest-resistant, and diverse native or site-appropriate species.</span><strong style=\"color: black;\"> </strong><strong>Action 1:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(115, 173, 28);\"> </span><span style=\"color: black;\">Facilitate funding to promote planting higher quality trees in urban forests with less emphasis on the quantity of trees planted (such as the published International Society of Arboriculture guidelines).</span></p> \n<p>In order to address these goals and strategies we need to know what urban tree species are available for purchase that are suitable for urban conditions and potentially withstand climate change impacts.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Forest Service\u2019s National Reforestation, Nursery, and Genetic Resource unit (RNGR) nursery directory on <a href=\"https://rngr.net/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: black;\">https://rngr.net</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"> </span>is the most comprehensive directory of forestry and conservation nurseries in the United States.

The directory is also expanding to include suppliers of products and services from seed to out planting. Soon, there will also be a marketplace to facilitate supply/demand.</p> \n<p>The RNGR nursery directory currently does not identify nurseries that address trees suitable for urban or developed environments or of those tree species, which may be resistant to climate change impacts such as, extreme heat, extreme temperature variations, pests, flooding, salt intrusion, high wind events, increased fire events, and ice storms to name a few. </p> \n<p><strong>The Forest Service is</strong> <strong>seeking an entity to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the existing RNGR nursery inventory. This may include additional inventories to identify new nurseries that can provide suitable urban and community forestry nursery stock, document urban tree species availability and / or public requests for desired suitable tree species from urban cities and communities across the country and U.S. Territories.</strong> </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Applicants are to follow the existing inventory template that the Forest Service RNGR unit has established but may introduce key components that are unique to urban and community forests. This may include specific desired tree characteristics, (i.e., native species or pest resistant species), innovative technologies, and methodologies to make it easier for a public search of the database.</p> \n<p><span style=\"color: black;\">Nurseries are public and private enterprises that are responsive to consumer demand, so the focus of this assessment is to develop a comprehensive list of tree species that are best suited to the geography, climate, and culture of urban and community forests across the country. </span></p> \n<p><strong>Required Registration in System for Award Management (SAM):</strong> Please allow at least two (2) weeks to apply or renew this registration.

        "synopsisDesc": "<p><strong>THIS IS A 2 PHASE APPROACH.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>SOI DUE: 18 December 2023 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>FULL PROPOSAL DUE: 19 January 2024</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Background</span></p>\n<p>There are many locks and dams, navigation channels, and increasingly beneficial sediment-use sites across the Mississippi watershed and throughout the United States.&nbsp;Interest is high in understanding navigation impacts on fisheries and how navigation infrastructure can be used to manage fisheries in the role of navigation. Currently, fisheries impacts are often not explicitly accounted for in lock and dam operations.&nbsp;For example, nearly all dams in the Mississippi Basin and southeastern United States are, by and large, not designed to accommodate fish passage for native fish.&nbsp;Moreover, many of these dams are now being viewed as possible components for control and management of aquatic nuisance species. Some native fishes are now protected under provisions of the Endangered Species Act further heightening interest in the possible influence of locks and dams on fish movement. A primary challenge of the proposed work is to develop strategies that allow fish movement past locks and dams while not impacting navigation operations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The National Information Collaboration for Ecohydraulics (NICE) has been established with the mission of applying ecohydraulic principles to navigation infrastructure at multiple scales and facilitating accurate engineering forecasts of fisheries outcomes based on research and development for multiple contexts.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Program Description/Objective: (brief description of the anticipated work)</span></p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to address the challenge of developing advanced numerical modeling near infrastructure with known accuracy and precision, especially in difficult-to-quantify environments such as dam gates wells, lock chambers, tailraces, and fishways. Multidimensional models are useful for estimating hydraulic conditions that influence fish, but the need for accuracy and precision in these applications is not well understood.&nbsp;In fact, new metrics of hydraulic model performance that incorporate observed fish behavior outcomes are needed to improve the utility of multidimensional models in predicting ecohydraulic outcomes.&nbsp;Field sites will be in the Mississippi River and its tributaries with a particular focus on application to future fish passage structures in the middle Mississippi River.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: windowtext;\">Public Benefit</span></p>\n<p>These studies will help ensure the preservation and protection of numerous threatened &amp; endangered (T&amp;E) fish species in the Mississippi River that could be impacted by a reduction in lock use. The protection of these fish species has been determined to be of national significance due to their past population decline. In addition to T&amp;E species, other aquatic species will also benefit from providing this hydrologic connectivity and thereby help maintain natural ecosystem trophic balances and biodiversity. Anticipated increases in public ecosystem goods and services from these environmental management decisions include aesthetic and economic value for present and future generations in areas such as recreational use, sports fishing, improved water quality, and naturally functioning ecosystems.</p>\n<p>.</p>",

WPTO\u2019s HydroWIRES Initiative seeks to understand, enable, and improve the contribution of hydropower, including pumped storage hydropower (PSH) to reliability, resilience, and integration in the rapidly evolving U.S. electricity system. Hydropower\u2019s flexibility is central to enhancing all these contributions. Through the three Topic Areas identified below, this FOA will develop a suite of advancements that improve hydropower flexibility at multiple scales: improved components within the plant, improved hybridized capabilities at the plant interconnection, and improved operations across the fleet.\r\n\r\n1. Hydropower Hybrids Demonstration\r\n2. Technologies to Increase Flexibility\r\n3. Operational Flexibility\r\n\r\nTo view the entire FOA document, visit the EERE Exchange Website at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov",

The grantee is expected to propose a robust academic subgrant program to investigate this relationship using existing secondary data, identifying and constructing novel data sets to further examine this relationship, and by supporting and growing a diverse academic community that is invested in sustaining research related to the relationship between WIC and maternal health outcomes. Subgrant program analyses will be required to examine the prevalence of these conditions by participation in WIC overall and by race, ethnicity, and age. The findings from this analysis will inform actions to improve maternal health in groups at highest risk for maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>",

        "synopsisDesc": "The Preservation Technology and Training (PTT) Grants are administered by the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), the National Park Service\u2019s innovation center for the preservation community. The 2024 PTT Grants are intended to create better tools, better materials, and better approaches to conserving buildings, landscapes, and cultural resources. The Grants should be seen as pushing the field of preservation forward and any application should be innovative in nature. The Grant\u2019s scope should disseminate to the broadest audience and impact national, regional, and/or local preservation practices.\u00a02024 Priorities. While all innovative applications will be reviewed, NCPTT\u2019s 2024 program prioritizes grant applications with the following themes:Innovative grant applications related to the utilization of augmented reality and machine learning for innovative approaches within the field of cultural resources are strongly encouraged.Innovative grant applications involving climate change response to fire related and inland hydrological (too much water, too little water) issues and their impacts on cultural resources are strongly encouraged.Innovative grant applications applying new techniques and technologies to the preservation field from descendant communities and underrepresented communities are strongly encouraged.\u00a0While NCPTT encourages applicants to address these research priorities, all grant applicants that are innovative in the field of preservation technology will be considered.\u00a0Programmatic GuidanceDigital Documentation: Any application for digital documentation of buildings or landscapes should go beyond the basic scanning of the cultural resource(s). Grant projects should investigate new ways to conduct, analyze, process, and disseminate digital documentation techniques, data, and use of final products. Projects that do not go beyond basic scanning of cultural resources will not be considered innovative.\u00a0Symposia, conferences, and training: any application for symposia, conferences, or training, must consider how the content is disseminated to a wider audience beyond the event participants.Media: as PTT grants are federally funded, media (i.e., podcasts and webinars) should be made available for publication on NCPTT\u2019s website for dissemination to as broad an audience as possible.\u00a0\u00a0PTT Grants will support the following activities:Innovative research that develops new technologies or adapts existing technologies to preserve cultural resources (typically $20,000)Specialized workshops or symposia that identify and address national preservation needs (typically $5,000 to $15,000)Media: how-to videos, podcasts, best practices publications, or webinars that disseminate practical preservation methods or provide better tools for preservation practice (typically $5,000 to $15,000)\u00a0PTT Grants will not fund the following:\u201cBrick and mortar\u201d grants.Publications for profit during the project funding cycle.Trainings that generate income to the applicant.Routine or well-established technologies.",

Work accomplished under this task will include data summarization and analysis to determine Fort Hood population size and trends as well as impacts of species management on regional population goals.&nbsp;Data will be used to populate annual report on status of endangered species at Fort Hood, Texas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 2: </strong>&nbsp;Monitoring of demographic parameters of endangered bird species.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2025 breeding season (March-July) this task will collect demographic data on endangered and at-risk bird (black-capped vireo and golden-cheeked warbler) occurrence, density and reproductive success at selected field monitoring sites on Fort Hood.&nbsp;This data will be used to investigate temporal and spatial variation in avian demographic parameters, with the goal of identifying effective management and conservation strategies. This work will require population census by conducting point count surveys on established point count routes for both species.&nbsp;Reproductive success will be investigated by locating and monitoring vireo nests at established monitoring plots.&nbsp;This work will require repeated nest visits and banding of nestlings.&nbsp;Adult warbler demography will be conducted by capturing and banding of breeding adults. This work will require personnel that either have current experience capturing passerine species using mist net capture techniques or can be trained and supervised by permitted personnel.&nbsp;This work will be conducted under current state and federal permits held by Fort Hood staff. This monitoring will be performed in accordance with protocols outlined in the Fort Hood ESMC.&nbsp;Work will begin upon authorization to proceed with anticipated start in spring 2025. Following the completion of the avian breeding season, demographic data will be analyzed to determine Fort Hood population size and trends as well as impacts species management on regional population goals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 3: </strong>&nbsp;Surveying and monitoring of migratory bird species.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2025 breeding season (March-August) this task will collect required demographic data on migratory bird occurrence, density and nest placement at selected field monitoring sites on Fort Hood.&nbsp;Sites will include areas with and without maneuver lane habitat modifications.&nbsp;Nest placement will be investigated by locating and monitoring nests of all migratory species at established monitoring plots. Recipient will conduct analyses to assess temporal and spatial trends in migratory bird abundance and reproductive efforts to inform management and conservation efforts. This work will be conducted under current state and federal permits held by Fort Hood staff. This monitoring will be performed in accordance with protocols outlined in the Fort Hood ESMC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 4</strong>: Surveying and monitoring of pollinator species.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During spring/summer 2025, this task will collect baseline data on butterfly populations on Fort Hood, with a focus on Monarch Butterflies.&nbsp;Surveys will include transect surveys through grassland habitats on the installation.&nbsp;Data will be collected on butterflies detected and milkweed stem counts to assess relationship between butterfly abundance/distribution and host plant density.&nbsp;Any monarchs detected will be netted and tagged for the Monarch Watch Program.&nbsp;Surveys and survey location determination will be conducted in collaboration with Fort Hood Natural Resources staff and ERDC-CERL.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 5</strong>: Survey and management of feral hogs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feral hogs cause massive habitat degradation through trampling and rooting.&nbsp;Largely because of the potential impacts on endangered and sensitive species habitats, Fort Hood actively monitors and manages the feral hog population.&nbsp;Throughout fall 2024 and spring 2025, this task will survey for feral pigs on the installation using a variety of methods including visual surveys for animals and/or rooting, aerial surveys and trapping.&nbsp;Recipient will conduct analyses to assess effectiveness of various feral hog survey and control methods for feral hog management. Surveys and survey location determination will be conducted in collaboration with Fort Hood Natural Resources staff and ERDC-CERL.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 6</strong>: Support for natural resources outreach activities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task will provide support for natural resources outreach activities for the local and installation communities.&nbsp;Specific activities will be determined based on input from Fort Hood Natural Resources personnel and ERDC-CERL but examples include Christmas and Breeding Bird Count, outreach to local schools regarding natural resource activities conducted at Fort Hood, learning materials for adults and children, and hosting nature walks on the installation for natural resources education.</p>",

                "forecastDesc": "The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support promising epidemiologic, behavioral, and implementation science research addressing the drivers of health inequities in racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately affected by HIV while strengthening the capacity for conducting such research among underrepresented investigators working in these communities. The NOFO supports CDC\u2019s goals to promote health and reduce disease and disability by funding research that has the potential to result in high public health impact.The NOFO is aligned with the federal initiative for Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States (EHE) by 2030. The EHE plan encompasses the following four key strategies: (i) diagnose all individuals with HIV as early as possible; (ii) treat people with HIV rapidly and effectively to reach sustained viral suppression; (iii) prevent new HIV transmissions by using proven interventions, including PrEP and syringe services programs (SSPs); (iv) respond quickly to potential HIV outbreaks to get needed prevention and treatment services to people who need them.\u00a0",
